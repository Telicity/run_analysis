Only 1 code file in project (run_analysis.R) and it has only 1 written function (run_analysis) included. Other commands used which must be able to be run are:

1. aggregate
2. as.character
3. c
4. cbind
5. grepl
6. join
7. list
8. mean
9. names
10. read.table
11. rbind
12. which
13. write.table

Note that the first few lines are commented out because the precise specifications for what is to be included in the repo expect that the data is already in the directory when the function is ran. Please make sure this is so.

Calling the run_analysis function writes a file called saAVG.txt which contains what was in r a data frame with 180 obserservations of 68 variables.
